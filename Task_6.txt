                                                          Task 6:Create a strong password and evaluate its strength


objective    : Understand  what makes a password strong and test it againist password strength tools.
Tools        : Online free password strength checker
Deliverables : Report showing password strength results and explanation.



* So inorder to check the password strength i googled password strength checkers i found some of the 
  offline free tools among those i have choose one perticular website known as "PasswordMonster".

* In next step i inserted password and it used to recommand and direct how my password should be inorder to increase the strength.
* after entering the password in a text layout it also gave information that how many long days it take's to crack the password by any hacker or anyone 
  who want to crack into my system or any of my important site's.
* I have performed variety of password and entered to the website to check the strength:
  A strong password contains Lowwercase(a-z) and Uppercase alphabets(A-Z) , Numbers(0-1), and also include certain special charecters inorder to increase 
  the complexity to crack the password.


--> Some of the password performed to check strength are as follows:

          How Secure is Your Password?

          Tip: Stronger passwords use different types of charactersShow password: 
      (i)                        Ge21!r3A)t
       * feed back : Very Strong
       Symbols Numbers Upper case Lower case
       10 characters containing:

Time to crack your password:
18 centuries
Review: Fantastic, using that password makes you as secure as Fort Knox.

* performed various variety of password and understood how regularly changing of password helps reducing threat's in the future.



---> BEST PRACTICES OF CREATING A STRONG PASSWORD:

1.Regularly update the password once a month.
2.Use combination of alphabets uppercase - Lowercase, Numbers and also include symbols.
3.Do not use common password for all sites use different password for different platforms.
4.Do not share password fo anyone keep it private.
5.Before entering any username or password to any website make sure those website are genuine which contains the protocol of https://"   ".


--->COMMON PASSWORD ATTACKS:

1. Brute Force Attack:
                     * The attacker tries all possible combinations of characters until the correct password is found.
                     
                     * Time-consuming but effective if password is weak and short.

2. Dictionary Attack
                    * Uses a predefined list of likely passwords, such as words from a dictionary.

                    * Faster than brute force; targets users who use common or simple passwords (like "password123").

3. Credential Stuffing
				   *	 Attackers use previously leaked usernames and passwords from data breaches.

				   *	 Exploits the habit of reusing passwords across websites.

4. Phishing
                    *  Users are tricked into entering their credentials on fake websites or emails.

				   *	  Highly effective due to social engineering.

5. Keylogging
				   *	  Malware or hardware secretly records keystrokes to capture passwords as you type.

                    *   Especially dangerous if systems are infected without detection.

6. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack
                    *   Attackers intercept data during transmission, often on unsecured networks.

                    *   If passwords are sent in plaintext, they can be easily captured.

7. Rainbow Table Attack
                    *   Uses a precomputed table of hash values to reverse cryptographic password hashes.

                    *   Mitigated by using salts (random data added before hashing).

8. Shoulder Surfing
                    *   Physically watching someone enter their password.

                    *   Common in public places like cafes or airports.

these are the commom password attacks.



---> Summary: How Password Complexity Affects Security
Password complexity directly increases security by making passwords harder to guess or crack using automated attacks.

1. Length Matters:
Longer passwords take exponentially more time to crack.

Example: 12+ characters is far more secure than 6 characters.

2. Character Variety Helps:
Using uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols makes brute-force and dictionary attacks much harder.

3. Unpredictability Is Key:
Avoiding common words, patterns, or personal info reduces risk from dictionary and social engineering attacks.

4. Resistance to Automation:
Complex passwords resist automated tools used in brute-force, rainbow table, and credential stuffing attacks.

In short: The more complex your password (in length and variety), the harder it is for attackers to break it  keeping your accounts safer.
