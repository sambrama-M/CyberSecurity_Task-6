# Task 6: Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

## Objective

Understand what makes a password strong and evaluate it using online password strength tools.

## Tools Used

* PasswordMonster (free online password strength checker)

## Contents of This Repository

* `Task_6.txt`: Detailed report of the task, including password tests and key observations.
* `screenshots/`: Folder containing screenshots of password strength evaluations and results.

## Task Summary

* Used PasswordMonster to test various passwords.
* Analyzed feedback and estimated time required to crack each password.
* Understood the role of complexity (length, variety, randomness) in password strength.

## Key Findings

* A strong password includes:

  * Uppercase and lowercase letters
  * Numbers
  * Special characters
  * At least 10 characters or more

* Sample strong password tested: `Ge21!r3A)t`

  * Feedback: Very Strong
  * Time to crack: 18 centuries

## Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords

1. Change passwords regularly (e.g., monthly).
2. Use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
3. Use different passwords for different websites/platforms.
4. Keep passwords private; do not share them.
5. Only enter passwords on secure (`https://`) websites.

## Common Password Attacks

* **Brute Force** – Attempts all combinations until successful.
* **Dictionary Attack** – Uses lists of common passwords.
* **Credential Stuffing** – Uses leaked passwords from breaches.
* **Phishing** – Tricks users into entering passwords on fake sites.
* **Keylogging** – Captures keystrokes to steal passwords.
* **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** – Intercepts passwords in transit.
* **Rainbow Table Attack** – Reverses hashed passwords using lookup tables.
* **Shoulder Surfing** – Observes you entering passwords in public.

## Conclusion: Why Password Complexity Matters

* Longer and more varied passwords are harder to crack.
* Complexity makes brute-force, dictionary, and automated attacks less effective.
* Unpredictable, unique passwords improve overall security.
